  Dinero lets you create, calculate, and format money safely in Deno.
</p>

---

Money is complex, and the primitives of the language aren't enough to properly represent it. Dinero is a Deno library that lets you express monetary values, but also perform mutations, conversions, comparisons, formatting, and overall make money manipulation easier and safer in your application.

## ⚡️ Quick start

`Dinero` objects are minimal. Every function in `dinero` is side-effect free, allowing you only to bundle exactly what you use.

```js
import { USD } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnhooks/dinero/2.0.0-alpha.10/currencies.ts";
import { dinero, add } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnhooks/dinero/2.0.0-alpha.10/mod.ts'";

const d1 = dinero({ amount: 500, currency: USD });
const d2 = dinero({ amount: 800, currency: USD });

add(d1, d2);
```
